**Start discussing the work right after the team members have come to the office**

You may be surprised! You, as a team leader, usually come to the office earlier to prepare for the work. And the fact is you and your team come to the office to work, not to play. Thus, should we start the standup immediately after all the team members have come? If the answer is Yes, congratulation! You are a BAD leader! You have failed for the first course. Everybody needs a small gap time after traveling to refresh their mind, especially with the terrible traffic condition in Vietnam.

Imagine that you are the guy who have spent 1 hour dealing with all the traffic jam, the dirt and the bad air quality. You come to the office and you are immediately asked for the progress of the work that you have been working on. What you gonna do? You mind is still full with all the annoying stuff on the street and you have bo idea what you are going to talk.

Always give your team members some time to refresh their mind and prepare for the work even if he comes a bit late (except in case of urgent issues)! Usually a 5-10 minutes period is a suitable time.

**Start the working day by a complain**

Right! Everybody knows this is bad. However, somebody just don't avoid it.

You caught some bugs caused by the other ones. You found that some of your team members didn't follow exactly what you said. You noticed that somebody didn't implement the correct requirements. And many other things! And you feel annoyed, you feel angry. And then you start complaining about all those problems right when you see your team members coming to the office. Congratulation! You behave like an asshole.

Nobody wants to start their day by a complain. Complains are good for the other people to know what is happenning, but not at the beginning of the day! Save your complains to later. Start your standup by asking them how they feel about their breakfast, their coffee, do they have any problems with the work yesterday, what you can help them,... not by complaining.

**Micro-Management**



**You are never satisfied by the work of your team members**

**You can not get agreeement with your team members**

> Ok! Whatever, just do whatever you want. I don't care!
> Ok! Whatever, this is good and you have to follow this.

If you have said the above things to your team members, you are going to lose them soon. Congratulation!

I have seen somebody debating with their team members and end up with something like the above sentences. That simply means you lack one of the most important skill of a leader. If your idea/point of debate is right, it means you don't have the necessary persuading skill to explain it to the other people. If your idea is wrong, it means are fucked off. You don't listen to the other people and just want them to do whatever you said. Either way, you have failed as a leader position.

**You team members simply accept whatever you say**

This is somewhat the consequences of the above one.

Debating is good in many manners. If helps you find the best solution. However, if the rate of debating decreases by the time, if a team member goes from willing to debate to simply accept whatever you said, you have failed already. If this the case, it's quite hard to find a way to bring back their interest in debating and you are going to lose them soon. They are actually working for money, not for interest!

If you are in this case, my suggestion, of course, is to fix this ASAP, try to listen to them in every discussion. However, also prepare for a future where you have to hire the other guys.

**You expect your people to be productive everday**



**You expect everybody to have the same level with you**
