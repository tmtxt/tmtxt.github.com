> By **Team leader**, I mean the Software Engineer team leader, who directly manages a team from 2 to 10 people.

In this post, you will see some actions/characteristics that can form an evil team leader. There are also other
signals that can help you realize the situation before it's too late. They reflect what I have seen
at work and talked with several friends working in the software industry. Of course, I'm not an
expert! They are based on my experience and just my personal point of view so take it easy, don’t be
too serious and enjoy reading!

> leader position.

So... what are they?

# 1. Start a working day with...

- Start work discussion right when you see your team members
- Start a working day with a complaint

You may be surprised! You and your team, of course, come to the office to work, not to play. Thus,
why the hell shouldn't we start the standup meeting (or other work discussion) immediately after the
team members have come? Sometimes, you catch a silly bug caused by somebody else or you find that
your team members didn't follow the requirements correctly and you start discussing and complaining
about them when you see your team members, asking about the reason and the fix. Somebody is so easy
to get angry that they don't mind the other people's feeling.

Imagine that you are the guy who have spent one hour or more dealing with all the traffic jam, the
dirt and the bad air quality (yeah, traffic condition in Vietnam is so terrible). You come to the
office and you are immediately asked for the progress of the tasks that you are working on, the bugs
that you are facing, the reason why you made that dumb thing, the solution to fix that. How do you
feel? Your mind is still full with all the annoying stuff on the street, your coffee has not been
ready, your laptop has not been turned on, your haven't checked your notes yet and you have no idea
what you are going to talk. How do you feel? Don't be an a**hole!

Everybody needs a small gap time after traveling to refresh their mind. Always give your team
members time to wash their faces, make their coffee, get their brain ready and prepare for the work
even if they come a bit late (except in case of urgent issues)! Usually at least 5-10 minutes is a
suitable time. Complaining at the beginning of the day also means that you haven't taken a serious
look into the problem. Sometimes, it is not because of your team members, it comes from you. Before
making any complaints, step back and analyze the problems, try to find what we can improve first.

# 2. Micro-Management

![Client](/files/2019-03-08-leader-stop-these-dumb-things/client.gif)

Everybody knows this is annoying, but somebody just don't mind avoiding it.

> If it was me, I would say: "Shut the f**k up! Thôi ông im mẹ mồm hộ tôi cái"

We are all adults. We don't need a guy acting as our parents behind us. A good software engineer
should be able to think independently and research the problem on his own. Otherwise, you chose your
teammate poorly. I feel that this kind of **Micro-Management** and **Pair Programming** is only suitable
for training junior guys and a new team member how to get started on the project. Let me repeat
that, just to train him **how to get started** on the project. We all need our own time to think
and observe the problem.

When you see these things
- You have to spend a lot of time to pair with the other guys
- You always feel you haven't explained enough

you know you are doing it the wrong way.

# 3. You set Unrealistic expectations

A team with no goals can never be successful. However, a team with unrealistic goals will fail
anyway.

- You expect everybody to be 100% productive everyday.
- You expect everybody to be at the same level or has the same level with you.
- You expect everybody to remember what they did.
- You expect everybody to devote their personal life for the work (unless they share the company
  equity).
- You expect everything...

I know you could be a talent, you could be a really good student with high score in school and
university, you could be a really good software engineer, you could code more than 10 hours a
day,... Yeah, you could be a Superman!

But...

It doesn't mean the other guys are also that talented. You need to understand that everybody has
their own strengths and weaknesses. You should
encourage them to lean and grow up but you shouldn't force them to be the same. You cannot force
all those guys to finish the task in the same amount of time (or the same with you). You cannot
force them to memorize everything they did in the past and complain them if they don't remember. You
cannot judge them when they cannot solve a problem that you think it's easy. You cannot expect
everybody to work at the same productivity everyday. That's non-sense!

So...

When you realize these things
- You **usually** have problem with your estimate
- You **usually** ask your team members why they didn't finish all the tasks you gave them
- You **usually** see you them implement the requirements incorrectly
- You **usually** find the other guys miss a lot of conventions that you have defined
- You **usually** ...

the problem may be you, not the other guys.

# 4. Your team members simply accept whatever you say

This is a dangerous signal!

Debating is good in many manners. If helps you find the best solution. However, if the rate of
debating decreases by the time, if a team member goes from willing to debate to simply accept
whatever you say, you have failed already. If this the case, it's quite hard to find a way to bring
back their interest in debating and you are going to lose them soon. They are actually working for
money, not for interest! The reason is very likely that they don't feel encouraged for discussing.
They may feel there will be no results for debating and everything will just be the same.

Have you ever said something like this?

- Ok! Just do whatever you want. I don't care!
- Ok! Whatever, this is good and you have to follow this.
- From my experience, this is good, you should follow it, you don't have enough experience to debate
  on this!
- ...

> Oh anh nói vậy thôi, các chú không làm có gì ráng chịu  
> Ok, sao cũng được, em cứ làm những gì em muốn, anh nói vậy thôi, anh không quan tâm!

This simply means you lack an important leadership skill. You need an expert on this, sometimes an
Agile Coach (if your company is following Agile) to make sure the discussion is going in the right
direction and we can agree on an output.

Otherwise, prepare to hire a new guy, you are going to lost your team members soon.

It doesn't mean you cannot level up. If you can improve the above things, that's good. Otherwise,
there are other positions for you. Somebody step up to be a specialist or a consultant for the
system. The key is to find the best way for you, don't do what you are not good at!
