**Start discussing the work right after the team members come to the office**
You may be surprised! You, as a team leader, usually come to the office earlier to prepare for the work. And the fact is you and your team come to the office to work, not to play. Thus, should we start the standup immediately after all the team members have come? If the answer is Yes, congratulation! You are a BAD leader! You have failed for the first course. Everybody needs a small gap time after traveling to refresh their mind, especially with the terrible traffic condition in Vietnam.

Imagine that you are the guy who have spent 1 hour dealing with all the traffic jam, the dirt and the bad air quality. You come to the office and you are immediately asked for the progress of the work that you have been working on. What you gonna do? You mind is still full with all the annoying stuff on the street and you have bo idea what you are going to talk.
