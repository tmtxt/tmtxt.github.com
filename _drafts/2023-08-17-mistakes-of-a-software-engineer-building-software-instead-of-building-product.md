Software engineers love technology, for sure. We love building
things, love applying the latest technology into our product. However, we usually forget
one important thing: The technology that doesn't fit in the product, cannot make a profitable
business, is a useless one. That sounds obvious, right? Surprisingly, a lot of Software Engineers
that I've met made this mistake, especially the talented ones.

Let me walk you through the 2 approaches, compare the differences between them and analyze some
real examples. In the next section, you can also find some techniques that I've applied in order to
help build a better Product Engineer work environment.

# What is Building Product?

In short, Building Product could be described as

> Delivering USER VALUES

Building Product usually includes these 3 main steps
- Identify the user problems
- Provide the solutions, using technology, and optionally, do it better than your opponents
- Constantly update and adapt to the changes of the business. If you don't keep up with the market,
you are losing already. A good product you build today could be a crap tomorrow.

In Building Product, you should NOT prioritize the technology. Yes, tech still plays an important
role but it is not the most important factor. You should always be focusing on the User Values.
Building Product is also not about Building a Perfect solution. Nothing is perfect. The business
changes every day. Spending time making one thing perfect means getting nothing done.
