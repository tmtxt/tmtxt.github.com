# Microservices

So, my journey to the Microservices world has last for nearly one year. And of course, every thing
has its bright side and the darkness waiting for me to explore. In the beginning, I came from the
surprised and excited feeling about how fast it is to develop small and re-usable components, how
easy it is to re-deploy and scale one small part of the application without taking down the whole
system and how effortless it is to change one small service to another more suitable technology.
However, as the development process goes on, there are more and more issues with the
Microservices architecture appears that we need to face with. Breaking down your system into several
small parts makes it very hard for tracing and debugging one error. The problem may happens in one
service but take root in other related component. Also, developing one individual small service
could be a simple task but combining them into one solid application is really a painful process
that requires thinking carefully about the designing and organization before entering Microservices
world. The problems are now transformed to the communication process between services.
