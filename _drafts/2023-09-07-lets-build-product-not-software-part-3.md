[Let's build Product, not Software - Part 2]({% post_url 2023-09-03-lets-build-product-not-software-part-2 %})

In the previous post, I have shown you a real example about how to solve the problem as a
Software Engineer. This time, we gonna do it by the Product Engineer approach.

> Make Agile great again!

If you refer to the first post that I wrote, Building Product is about delivering user values,
collect feedbacks and constantly adapt to the change of business. Does it sound like Agile?
Yes, in my opinion, Agile seems to be the best fit our there for Product company at a small
and medium size.

# Incremental delivery

<b><u>The requirements</u></b>

Imagine that your task is to deliver these parcels to a recipient. What is the best way to bring
them all to the crying person waiting for his goods?

The most common way that most people would choose, of course, is to try to carry them all at once.

<b><u>Some challenges</u></b>

- It is too risky. You can easily drop and damage the parcels
- Multi-tasking is always hard. You have to keep track of all the boxes on your hand
(and your head ðŸ¤£)

<b><u>Obstacles appear</u></b>

What happens if you realize you cannot reach the recipient?
