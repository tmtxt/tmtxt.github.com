# There is nothing called Schemaless

One argument that people usually mention about NoSQL is the flexibility in schema designing. They
are Schemaless databases and very similar to objects in programming language. They dynamic schema is very
flexible and can support several different use cases, not limited like what SQL provides. You can
just throw your objects into it and do anything you want.
