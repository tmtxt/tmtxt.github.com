I have been dreaming about a unified dev environment for everybody in the team, where there's no
more "It works on my machine" issue. The dev environment should be portable, automatically
configured and can be destroyed/recreated as quick as possible. It should also provide all the
necessary tools for the developer as well as enforce everyone in the team to follow the correct
convention.
