It has been nearly 4 years since I graduated. I have been working for 3 companies, started with an outsourcing company (Cogini) to a large online shopping company (Lazada) and finally ended up at a small startup-like company (Agency Revolution). Cogini used to be my dream when I was a university student. Lazada gave me the motivation to discover the new environment. Agency Revolution changed my mind completely about software development and taught me a lot about how the business works beside just coding.
