> Microservices is not the only way to decouple application components!

# Let's talk about Microservices again

Quite often, when we want to scale an application, people think about microservices first because of the benefits they offer. Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular due to several compelling advantages:

- decouple business logic into independent services
- each team owns and maintains their own services without affecting others
- simple to perform rolling upgrades on specific parts without downtime
- scale individual components based on demand rather than the entire monolith
- more efficient resource utilization and cost savings through selective scaling

# Is it the only way?
