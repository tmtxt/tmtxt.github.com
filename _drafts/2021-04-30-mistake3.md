# SQL can scale very well.

Some people debate that the main difference between SQL and NoSQL is that SQL is designed for
vertical scaling and NoSQL is designed for horizontal scaling. That means NoSQL can scale better
than SQL, especially for high read/write throughput application. For me, it's somewhat true but not
always. I agree that many NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scaling in mind. However, it
doesn't mean SQL cannot scale. I have seen many systems backed by SQL with a very large dataset and
they still perform very well.

Depending on the type of operation that you use, each database can scale better in a different
manner. With decades of development, SQL would have been abandoned 

# Choosing a database system with a Product perspective

So, how do I choose a database system from my Product engineer view?

> The answer is: It depends. (of course ðŸ˜‚)

However, most of the time, my answer would be SQL, except for some very specific requirements. The
philosophies of the 2 database systems are different so don't force one to do the job
