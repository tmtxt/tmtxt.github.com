Well, you can guess what I'm going to talk from the title of this post? Yes, it's about how people
are being hyped about Event Sourcing (ES) and trying to apply it in an incorrect way. Don't get me
wrong! ES pattern is not an evil. In fact, it has been widely used in a lot of big companies and
popular product. However, there is nothing in this tech world that could serve as a Swiss Army
Knife, one thing for all purposes. How to apply it at the right place an in a correct way is
problematic.

In this first part of the series, I'm going to cover what Event Sourcing is, the motivation behind it and
some basic solutions for implementing an Event Sourcing system. After this, you will have a clear
overview about ES philosophy. Next, I'll walk you through some real examples that I've seen and the
problems they have. In the end, there will be some suggestions to get into the ES world.

# Why Event Sourcing?

What is the motivation for people to move to ES? What are the issues with the traditional way of
modelling data and designing the application?

Usually, in an application with relational database, the entities are organized into tables. Every
time a user initiates an action, the application server sends another request to the database
server to update data. For example, to update the email of a user, it needs to overwrite the
existing email value with the new one. So straight forward? So what's the problems? Let's consider
these requirements

- How do I know if any user using this email `event@truongtx.me` in the past?
- What happen if I find that the logic to increase the user balance is incorrect? It could be
because we missed applying the promotion for specific users?
- How about auditing?
- What if I want to analyze the data in the past? Ex to find out if users who have changed their
email typically have a higher balance than users that have never changed their email?
