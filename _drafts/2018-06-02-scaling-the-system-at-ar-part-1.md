As the time of this writing, I have been working at Agency Revolution (AR) for more than 2 years, on
a product focusing mostly on automation email marketing for the Insurance Agencies. I have been
working on this product since it was in beta, when it could only serve only a few clients, send
thousands of emails each month and handle very little amount of integration data without downtime
until it can deliver millions of emails each month, store and react to terabytes of data flow every
day. The dev team has been working very hard and suffering a lot of problem to cope with the
increasing number of customers that the sale team bring to us. Here are some techniques and
strategies that we have applied until now in order to bring a better user experience.

that you couldn't imagine before. I wrote another post about some of the disadvantages in
Microservices here, feel free to take a look at
