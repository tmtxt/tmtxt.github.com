Technical debts are everywhere. The AR system that I'm currently working on is the same. There are
many good improvements that we have made to scale out the system. Nodejs is a good choice for
startup time, when we first developed the product because it's easier, fast to develop
(**Build first, Optimize later**). However, we are not startup anymore. The ultimate goal now is to
increase the reliability of the system while keep adding new features. There are several reasons
that I cannot stick with Nodejs anymore and decided to move to C# (.Net Core).

- Nodejs is not strict typing. No matter how strict your convention is or how senior your team is,
  you will definitely run into some silly problems with its flexibility.
- The system runs on Nodejs, Microservice architecture and Rethinkdb. All of them operate based on a
  very **loose** model: loose-coupling components, loose-typing language and a lack-of-constraint
  database. Microservice architecture is not a bad design, it's our problem for spliting the
  components incorrectly. ðŸ˜…
- There are many good design patterns that is not available (or actually hard to do) in Nodejs, for
  example SOLID design. This may not be the problem of Nodejs, but the other language makes it
  easier to do so.
- The Nodejs community is ****. There are not many things with long term support out there. For
  .Net, at least, I can rely on Microsoft (a big guy) to ensure my future. I don't want the
  product to run into trouble one day.
- Microsoft now is not the dictator that I used to know anymore. I'm happy to develop with .Net Core
  on my Macbook and run it on my Linux server inside the Docker environment that I'm familiar to.
  It's also easy to find .Net dev in Vietnam.
