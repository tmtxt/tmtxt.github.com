Technical debts are everywhere. The AR system that I'm currently working is the same. There are many good improvements that we have made to scale out the system. However, since we are a product company, the philosophy that we always follow is **Build first, Optimize later**. The most important thing is to get into the market and deliver the values to the customer ASAP. We sometimes have to decide to leave some technical debts in the system and accept some minor bugs, as long as there is a workaround for it and it doesn't affect the core value of the system. And now, it's time to solve refactor ðŸ˜…

For me, the biggest problem of the AR system is the heavy use of Nodejs, Microservice architecture and Rethinkdb. All of them operate based on a very **loose** model: loose-coupling components, loose-typing language and a lack-of-constraint database.
