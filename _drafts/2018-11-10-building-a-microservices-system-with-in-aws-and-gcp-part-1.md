Over the last 3 years, I have been building a **Microservice** system for **Agency Revolution** almost
using GCP - Google Cloud Platform. The system runs in GKE - Google Kubernetes Engine, which features
a Traditional method (or *Serverful* architecture, as I couldn't imagine any better word opposite to
*Serverless* :LOL:). Recently, I've moved to another project, which makes use of the **Serverless**
architecture using **Amazon Lambda** technology. There were pros and cons for both methods,
it's hard to say which one is better. I'm just going to summarize the building process, the
philosophy as well as some experience when building the Microservices that I have been working over
the last 3 years.
