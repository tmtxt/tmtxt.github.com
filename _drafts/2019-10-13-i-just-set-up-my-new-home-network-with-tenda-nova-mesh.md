So, here is the problem. Although my apartment is just a small one, the distance between the Wifi
router and my PC is also not far, they are separated by some wall layers.

The Wifi router that I'm using is an old Apple Airport from 2011, which seems not enough to break
through these wall layers. I usually have problem with low Wifi signal on my PC, which makes playing
CS:GO much frustrating. I usually get killed by the delay because I cannot see clearly the movement of
the enemies, they move like teleporting :LOL:
