(read ...) that reach the state of the art of RethinkDB and help us scale the system to serve our users better. I personally couldn't imagine that we could scale that big with a schemaless database but we did. The system now delivers millions of email every month, automates many repetitive boring marketing tasks, provides a detailed insight to the customer activities and help our users grow their business through a better automation marketing platform. However, my overall experience with NoSQL has been very bad, especially when we combine with a dynamic programming language like Nodejs. We have reached its limit and it started exposing problems

# The problem of large objects


# The performance cost

Some people debate that NoSQL databases are better used for heavy-read applications. The
argument is that reading the whole document object is much faster than reading through many fields
of one row (including the null fields). I cannot


# Schemaless doesn't Reduce the complexity or Save your development time

# The problem of Relationship

# The lack of Transactions

# Schema changes - Migration

For me, this is a nightmare when working with NoSQL.
