The default Jekyll Bootstrap index file contains a simple post list. However, it is
really boring. It just gives you very basic information like Pulished date, Post
title and the link to that post. After a little researching about the supported liquid
tags in Jekyll, I came up with a new index page with the more
beautiful post list, including thumbnail, post title, summary of the post, read
more buttons and much more things you can add to.

Here are the implementation steps. Remember this is for Jekyll Bootstrap. That
means you need Jekyll with Bootstrap to implement. If you don't use bootstrap
you can still apply those steps with a few tweaks.

# Add Thumbnail property for post

By default Jekyll does not add any thumbnail image property for post so we need to
add one more property for the post. In the beginning of every post file is the
declaration section. Just add one more property called thumbnail for it.

{% highlight bash %}
layout: post
title: "Thumbnail Post List for Jekyll Bootstrap"
description: ""
category:
thumbnail: /files/2013-01-05-thumbnail-post-list-for-jekyll-bootstrap/thumbnail.png
tags: [tutorial, thumbnail, post, jekyll, bootstrap]
{% endhighlight %}

If you're using Jekyll Bootstrap, to avoid having to manually add the thumbnail
property everytime you create the
post, add it the the rake task. Edit the **Rakefile** in the root directory of your
jekyll site. Find these lines and add the thumbnail property

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Creating new post: #{filename}"
open(filename, 'w') do |post|
  post.puts "---"
  post.puts "layout: post"
  post.puts "title: \"#{title.gsub(/-/,' ')}\""
  post.puts 'description: ""'
  post.puts "category: "
  post.puts "thumbnail: "
  post.puts "tags: []"
  post.puts "---"
  post.puts ""
{% endhighlight %}

Now everytime you execute the command **rake post** to create a new post, it
will also create the thumbnail property for you.

# Prepare the image

You will need one default image for jekyll to use in case the post does not have
the thumbnail property. Just pick the one you like and put it somewhere
in your web directory. For example, I put the image named **nothumbnail.jpg** in
the **images** folder in the root directory of my site.

# Design the page

Now the most important thing, design the page where you would like those
thumbnail post list will appear. Open the page where you want the list to be appear.
In my case I put them into my index file.

I used the Bootstrap layout here so remember to include the Bootstrap css file
before.

# First 3 latest posts

First select 3 latest posts to display in the 3 column using the Bootstrap
layout. Add these code to where you want them to appear.

```html
<div class="row">
  {{ "{% for post in site.posts limit:3 "}}%}
  <div class="span4">
    <a href="{{ "{{ BASE_PATH "}}}}{{ "{{ post.url "}}}}"><h2>{{ "{{ post.title "}}}}</h2></a>
	<hr />
	<p>{{ "{% if post.thumbnail "}}%}
	<img src="{{ "{{ post.thumbnail "}}}}" style="height: 280px" align="center" />
	{{ "{% else "}}%}
	<img src="/images/nothumbnail.jpg"
  style="height: 280px" align="center" />
	{{ "{% endif "}}%}</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
	{{ "{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords:20 "}}}}
	</p>
	<p>
	<a class="btn" href="{{ "{{ BASE_PATH "}}}}{{ "{{ post.url "}}}}">Read more...</a>
	</p>
  </div>
  {{ "{% endfor "}}%}
</div>
```

In the code above, replace **/images/nothumbnail.jpg** with the link to your no
thumbnail image. The <b>{{ "{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords:20 "}}}}</b> is the preview of post, which is html stripped and truncated to 20
words.

Here is the demo image

<img src="/files/2013-01-05-thumbnail-post-list-for-jekyll-bootstrap/3posts.png"
style="border-style:solid; border-width:2px" />

# The rest

Now, I will select next 15 latest posts to display. Of course we do not choose
all the post to display. If the audience want to view all posts, give them the
archive page link =) To display the next 15 posts, we need 2 arguments on the
liquid for loop: **limit:15** and **offset:3**

Add this code to where you want it to display

```html
{{ "{% for post in site.posts limit:15 offset:3 "}}%}
<hr />
<div class="row">
  <div class="span2">
    {{ "{% if post.thumbnail "}}%}
	<img src="{{ "{{ post.thumbnail "}}}}" align="center" />
	{{ "{% else "}}%}
	<img src="/assets/themes/tmtxt-responsive/images/no-thumnail.jpg" align="center" />
	{{ "{% endif "}}%}
  </div>
  <div class="span10">
    <p><a href="{{ "{{ BASE_PATH "}}}}{{ "{{ post.url "}}}}"><h3>{{ "{{ post.title "}}}}</h3></a></p>
	<p>{{ "{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 40 "}}}}
	</p>
  </div>
</div>
{{ "{% endfor "}}%}
```

Here is the demo image

<img src="/files/2013-01-05-thumbnail-post-list-for-jekyll-bootstrap/rest.png"
style="border-style:solid; border-width:2px" />

# Update

In these above steps, the preview of the post is always truncated at 20 (or some
constant number of) words automatically. To manually truncate it in wordpress
style, follow this post [Jekyll - Read More without plugin]({%post_url 2013-05-01-jekyll-read-more-feature-without-any-plugin%})
