> and it is deadly simple

So, here is the problem. Although my apartment is just a small one, the distance between the Wifi
router and my PC is also not far, they are separated by some wall layers.

The Wifi router that I'm using is an old Apple Airport from 2011, which seems not enough to break
through these wall layers. I usually have problem with low Wifi signal on my PC, which makes playing
CS:GO much frustrating. I usually get killed by the delay because I cannot see clearly the movement of
the enemies, they move like teleporting :LOL: I also don't want to set up any wire from the living
room to my bedroom, which would makes my apartment become ugly! I want a tidy place.

# Say hello Tenda Nova Mesh

Here are some images when unboxing and setting up the system

Three cute small boxes!

Place it next to my 49" Samsung Smart TV

Quite nice and suitable to place as a decoration in the living room!

Another one on my Bookshelf (with a lot of Doraemon comic books)

A closer look. Behind are the PowerCube power extension and an Anker 4-port Charger

The setup is also deadly simple! Just install the App on my phone and follow the instructions. All
the three devices will connect to each other automagically

# Let's pick up the guns!

All my devices can connect to the Wifi without any problems at all! I was very disappointed when
using the Totolink EX200 Wifi repeater. None of my Apple devices can connect to it and use the
internet, only Windows devices only.

OK, I'm going to try with one CS:GO Arm Race match now! :LOL:

Ping is stable at 43-46ms! Yay, no more getting killed by LAG :YOLO:

# My thought

**Good**
* Cheap!
* Easy setup
* Strong signal for small apartment

**Bad**
* Few LAN ports, but yeah, I don't need
* The LAN speed is not very high, but I also don't have the need to transfer files using LAN network
  much
