I won't mention about setting up Codespaces or Devcontainer as it's already on their documentation
page. In this post, I'll show you some of the problems and example workflows that I did with
Codespaces/Devcontainer.

# Dev credentials and Environment variables

Your organization may created some private packages that requires some layers of authentication in
order to install (the npm packages hosted on GCP for example). One possible solution is to create
an access token (or any other type of credential) and put set it in your development environment.
For Codespaces, you can simply set it on your Github configuration page. However, for Devcontainer,
it needs a bit more work. The idea is to mount the environment file from outside of the container
and then load those variables to Devcontainer

Create an env file on your computer, for example `/var/devcontainer-mount/workflow.env`, which
contains all the secrets that you want to inject
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="xxx"
```

Mount the folder to your Devcontainer by adding a mount volume to your **devcontainer.json** file.
Read more here [Add another local file mount](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/add-local-file-mount)
```json
{
  //...other config
  "mounts": [
    {
      "source": "/var/devcontainer-mount",
      "target": "/workspaces/devcontainer-mount",
      "type": "bind"
    }
  ]
}
```

In your Devcontainer bootstrap file (usually defined under `updateContentCommand` section in your
**devcontainer.json** file), load those variables before executing any script
```bash
if [[ -e "/workspaces/devcontainer-mount/workflow.env" ]]; then
  echo "Sourcing secret env file..."
  source "/workspaces/devcontainer-mount/workflow.env"
fi
```

You can also make these variables available by default in your VSCode Terminal or in SSH session
by adding it to your shell's startup files. For example, if you use zsh with a Node Devcontainer,
add this to your bootstrap file
```bash
touch /home/node/.zshenv
cat /workspaces/devcontainer-mount/workflow.env >> /home/node/.zshenv
```

# Git config not shared properly with Devcontainer

It's suggested that you install [git-credential-manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager)
when working with Devcontainer. However, it only transfers the credential, not the configurations (git username and user email).
Codespaces set these values automatically based your Github account. For Devcontainer, you need
to do it manually.

Continue with the `workflow.env` file that I mentioned above, add your Git details
```bash
GIT_USER_NAME="Tony Tran"
GIT_USER_EMAIL="my.email@my-company.com"
```

and then in your bootstrap file (after sourcing the env file)
```bash
git config user.name > /dev/null || gitUserNameCheck=$?
if [[ -n "$gitUserNameCheck" && -n "$GIT_USER_NAME" ]]; then
  echo "Setting Git user.name"
  git config --global user.name "$GIT_USER_NAME"
fi

git config user.email > /dev/null || gitUserEmailCheck=$?
if [[ -n "$gitUserEmailCheck" && -n "$GIT_USER_EMAIL" ]]; then
  echo "Setting Git user.email"
  git config --global user.email "$GIT_USER_EMAIL"
fi
```

# docker-in-docker and its bugs

Your Devcontainer/Codespaces instance is actually a Docker container (or can be treated as another
computer). You can install any database engine into it and connect directly. However, for
simplicity, we usually just pull a docker image with the database engine already bundled. You can
also easily find other docker images for different backing services, for example Pubsub emulator.

Devcontainer supports running
[docker inside docker](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/docker-in-docker).
Once you have enabled and recreated your Devcontainer, just use all the Docker commands normally
inside your Devcontainer

This is an example of Docker running inside Docker Devcontainer

However, I usually get these below issues when using this feature, sometimes on first rebuild of
the container or sometimes when the container is started

![docker issue 1](/files/2024-04-19-a-unified-dev-environment/docker-issue-1.jpg)
![docker issue 2](/files/2024-04-19-a-unified-dev-environment/docker-issue-2.jpg)

I figured out the issue is that Docker service inside Devcontainer sometimes fail to start. You can
simply run this command inside Devcontainer/Codespaces to fix

```
/usr/local/share/docker-init.sh
```

It may still fail after you run the above init command in case you run it inside your iTerm via an
SSH session. In that case, simply run any Docker commands (`docker compose up` for example) inside
**VSCode Terminal** and then come back to your SSH window. 99% it will work in both VSCode and SSH
after that. I guess it's because VSCode terminal has some environment variable set by default
related to Docker RPC. ðŸ« 

# E2E and UI Tests

Devcontainer acts like another computer and we connect to it via our VSCode/Jetbrains terminal
or SSH session. For UI testing with browser, you can only run in headless mode. Luckily,
Devcontainer comes with a builtin feature, providing us a minimal VNC desktop UI. It can be
connected using any VNC client or directly via WebUI. You can enable it following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite).

After you have rebuilt your Devcontainer/Codespaces, simply install any browser or UI test
framework that you want and start them in headful mode. You can easily access that VNC desktop
via browser
