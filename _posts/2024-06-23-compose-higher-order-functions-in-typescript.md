# Initial problem

It's the classic logging issue again! In the Warehouse Management system that I'm working on, the
team usually needs to add this logging pattern

```typescript
const sendToteToPackingStation = (warehouseId: string, toteId: string): Promise<Result> => {
  logger.info('Sending tote to packing station', { warehouseId, toteId });

  const result = await someLogic(...);

  logger.info('Send tote result', { result });
  return result;
};
```

The purpose is simple. It's what you have to do for production debugging in every system. You should
write out some unique ids so you have a place to start querying your logging system.
From that point, you will then trace the related entries using a correlation id that your system
provides.

From time to time, when the system scaled up, there were new areas that could slow down the system.
We then added more logging logic to the system, for example, execution time logging to help build
some visualization dashboards to identify the root cause.

```typescript
const sendToteToPackingStation = (warehouseId: string, toteId: string): Promise<Result> => {
  const startTime = performance.now();

  logger.info('Sending tote to packing station', { warehouseId, toteId });
  const result = await someLogic(...);
  logger.info('Send tote result', { result });

  logger.info('Execution time', { durationMs: elapsedTimeMs(startTime) });
  return result;
};
```

Of course, when this was repeated multiple times, we started thinking about making a higher order
function (HOF) to reuse everywhere is the system

# First implementation...

Let's begin with the type definition. Here are the generic types how a HOF looks like. It's a
function that receives a function and return another function with the same signature with the
input function

```typescript
export type WrappedFunction<
  FunctionArgs extends ReadonlyArray<unknown>,
  FunctionReturn
> = (...args: FunctionArgs) => FunctionReturn;

export type HigherOrderFunction = <
  FunctionArgs extends ReadonlyArray<unknown>,
  FunctionReturn
>(
  func: WrappedFunction<FunctionArgs, FunctionReturn>
) => WrappedFunction<FunctionArgs, FunctionReturn>;
```

<!-- more -->

And here is the first basic implementation

```typescript
export const withLogging: HigherOrderFunction =
  (wrappedFunction) =>
  (...args) => {
    const functionName = wrappedFunction.name || wrappedFunction.constructor.name;
    logger.info(`Running function ${functionName}`, { args });
    const startTime = performance.now();

    const result = wrappedFunction(...args);
    logger.info(`Finished ${functionName}`, {
      result,
      durationMs: elapsedTimeMs(startTime)      
    });

    return result;
  };

const sendToteToPackingStationFn = (warehouseId: string, toteId: string): Promise<Result> => {...}
export const sendToteToPackingStation = withLogging(sendToteToPackingStationFn);
```

# ...but it introduced other problems

- There are some cases that we want to log only the input and the execution time because the output
object is too large and can slow down the system. We had to introduced another HOF
`withParamsLogging` just for that purpose. Finally, we ended up with a lot of overlapping HOFs like
that in our system.
- For function output logging, depending on the case, we have different ways of returning data.
Sometimes, it's a normal object with a `status`/`outcome` prop. In some other cases, we have to
return an object from [neverthrow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neverthrow) library. It's hard to
maintain an HOF for multiple purposes. It usually becomes too complex and contains a lot of 
`if/else` to make sure we log the right way.
- We cannot use just part of the logic of the HOF, for example, only log execution time of the input
function.

# Composable Small HOFs

Inspired by [Redux compose](https://redux.js.org/api/compose) function, it doesn't take much time
to resolve all the above problems with a composable approach. Instead of making big and generic
HOFs, I decided to split them into smaller HOFs, each HOF is responsible for 1 and only 1 single
purpose, for example

- `withInputLogging` and `withOutputLogging` to log the input and output of a function
- `withNeverthrowOutputLogging` for logic specific to logging **neverthrow** output object
- `withExecutionTimeLogging`
- `withPubsubLogging` automatically sends the data to pubsub
- `withUnhandledErrorLogging` beautifies the unhandled error and rethrows it
- ...

To combine them, implement a `compose` function like this

```typescript
export const compose =
  (...hofs: Array<HigherOrderFunction>): HigherOrderFunction =>
  (wrappedFunction) =>
  (...args) => {
    if (!hofs.length) {
      return wrappedFunction(...args);
    }

    const [head, ...tail] = hofs;
    const finalFunc = tail.reduce(
      (res, hof) => hof(res),
      head(wrappedFunction)
    );

    return finalFunc(...args);
  };
```

and then you can decide which HOFs you want to use in each individual case

```typescript
export const sendToteToPackingStation = compose(
  withInputLogging,
  withOutputLogging,
  withExecutionTimeLogging,
)(sendToteToPackingStationFn);
```

# Make it work with Promise

You may notice that the above logging utils don't really play nicely with Promise. To fix it, just
add a `finally` block if the return data is a Promise.

```typescript
//...
const result = wrappedFunction(...args);

if (isPromise(result)) {
  result.finally(() => logFinishTime());
} else {
  logFinishTime();
}
//...
```

# Include extra information

You may find yourself need to include some extra information to the HOFs, for example, to log a key
that you can use to correlation the business logic. In that case, simply turn that HOF to a
function that return the actual HOF (yes, it's a function returning a function returning a
function ðŸ˜…).

```typescript
export const withInputLogging =
  (opts: { action?: string } = {}): HigherOrderFunction =>
  (wrappedFunction) =>
  (...args) => {
    logger.info('Start hof', { action, args })
    //...
  };

// or to specify the pubsub topic to publish to?
export const withPubsubLogging =
  (opts: { topic: string }): HigherOrderFunction =>
  (wrappedFunction) =>
  (...args) => {
    client.publish(topic, { args });
    //...
  };
```
