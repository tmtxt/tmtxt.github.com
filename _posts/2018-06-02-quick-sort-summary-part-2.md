# Selection Problem

Given an array of N items, find a k<sup>th</sup> smallest item. For example, an array A =
`[5, 2, 9, 4, 10, 7]`, the 3rd smallest item is `5`, the 2nd smallest item is `4` and the smallest
item is `2`

# The idea

- Based on Quick Sort
- Partition the array so that
  - Entry `a[j]` is in place.
  - No larger entry to the left of `j`
  - No smaller entry to the right of `j`
- Repeat in one sub-array, depending on `j`, finished when `j` equals `k`

# Java Implementation

```java
public static Comparable select(Comparable[] a, int k) {
    StdRandom.shuffle(a);
    int lo = 0, hi = a.length - 1;
    while (hi > lo)
    {
        int j = partition(a, lo, hi);
        if (j < k) lo = j + 1;
        else if (j > k) hi = j - 1;
        else return a[k];
    }
    return a[k];
}
```

The idea is that, after each partition, the item `a[j]` will be moved to the right place. So it will
become the **j<sup>th</sup>** smallest item. Repeat that process until we can find `j = k`.

# Performance

**Quick-select** takes **linear** time on average. **Quick-select** uses **~Â½ N<sup>2</sup>**
compares in the worst case, but (as with quicksort) the random shuffle provides a probabilistic
guarantee.
